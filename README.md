# SneakySneaky
A customised version of Athlon1600's php-proxy-app.


## Description
SneakySneaky is a simple web proxy that allows you to bypass blocked sites. It is based off of [php-proxy-app](https://github.com/Athlon1600/php-proxy-app) with some slight changes and improvements. Feel free to use it at [SneakySneaky.tk](https://sneakysneaky.tk) or [Sneeky.tk](https://sneeky.tk) for short.


## Changes
Here's a list of what's currently different from the main php-proxy-app:
* More clean/modern look
* Background by [Trianglify](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify)
* Google search in URL bar
* Auto-hide URL bar on scroll
* Semi-transparent URL bar
* Added [SecurityPlugin](https://github.com/Athlon1600/php-proxy-plugin-bundle/pull/2) (fixes a few major security flaws in main version)
* ðŸŒ½
* Enabled HD YouTube videos
* Made YouTube a bit cleaner
* Enlarged the YouTube player (better for 1080p screens)
* Server based in Australia (not really a change, just thought I'd mention it)


## Issues
Unless you want to point something out that I've obviously done, please make an issue [here](https://github.com/Athlon1600/php-proxy-app/issues). Same goes with pull requests.
